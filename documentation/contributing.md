Tablecloth is an ideal library to contribute to, even if you're new to OCaml.

The maintainers are warm and friendly, and the project abides by a [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

There are many small tasks to be done and even a small change to a single function's documentation is extremely helpful.

Here are some ways to contribute:

- Check out the issues marked [help wanted](https://github.com/darklang/tablecloth/labels/help%20wanted), especially those marked [good first issue](https://github.com/darklang/tablecloth/labels/good%20first%20issue)
- Fix a typo or grammatical error
- Add test cases
- Add examples
- Add documentation
- Point out a way in which the library or any of its parts are confusing
- Point out inconsistencies between different functions in the library
- Report an edge-case or performance problem in one of the functions
- Improve a function's documentation by discussing an edge-case
- Check a function cannot throw exceptions (and add a note to the function documentation to that effect)
- Suggest a new function or module by [creating an issue](https://github.com/darklang/tablecloth/issues/new).
- Optimize a function

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to start [open an
issue](https://github.com/darklang/tablecloth/issues/new) with your thoughts
or stop by the *#tablecloth* channel in the [Darklang discord](https://darklang.com/discord-invite).

## Guiding principles

### Over-communicate

Create an issue first!

If you are planning on removing, changing or adding new features to `Tablecloth`, please open an issue first.

### Small pull requests

Many small PR's are better than one big one.

Don't save up small changes for one big PR if you can avoid it.

Small PR's are less likely to cause conflicts, easier to review and take less effort.
